%\section{Projects}
%\textbf{A Machine Learning Approach for Taming Compiler Fuzzers} \hfill \textit{(2014)}\newline
%In context of the course “Machine Learning” during the Spring 2014 term, we developed a comparative approach to tame Compiler Fuzzers. The purpose of the project was to practice machine learning by doing, as well as to experience with different clustering techniques. We improved the state-of-the-art, as our approach found more unique bugs than the state-of-the-art.\\
%
%\textbf{Augmented Reality Mirror: aMir} \hfill \textit{(2010)}\newline
%In context of the course “Ubiquitous Computing” during the autumn term 2009 we developed a prototype of a augmented mirror called “aMir”. The purpose of the project was to practice interaction design by doing, as well as to experience the value of prototyping. The project also brought together technical knowledge with more design-oriented thinking of IT.\\
%
%\textbf{Corvallis Android App} \hfill \textit{(2013)}\newline
%In context of the course “Mobile and Cloud Software Development” I developed an android app called “Corvallis” for the city of Corvallis. The purpose of the project was to practice mobile software development, as well as to create a means to keep track of the events in the little town I was living in.
